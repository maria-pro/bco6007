# Assessment

- **In class tests**: 3 throughout the semester (25%)

- **Practical exercises**: data wrangling and manipulation, individual. 
Very practical! (35%)

- **Research report**: a report based on data analysis + presentation, groups of 2. Practical + research (40%)

*Hints*:  

- Form your groups early, so you can start working on your project

- Make sure you set up your group at VU Collaborate -> Communication -> Groups

- Exchange your details, including non-VU emails and phone numbers.

- Great idea to use WhatsApp and Zoom!

- As well as set up common space to store your files: e.g. OneDrive / Dropbox

# Expectations

- Turn up to class, summarise your notes after each, note what you understand, and what you don't

- Do exercises from the textbook related to material each week, check your answers with solution️s

- Participate actively in computer labs, work with team mates to solve problems, get best answers 

.footnote[[*] I update my class material every week, so need to check them in before the class!]

#Coding?

**This is NOT a programming unit! We focus on data**

Why R:

- Free software environment 

- Widely used among statisticians and data analysts

- Easy to learn and use for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and graphics

- Used by many large companies: uUber, Google, Airbnb, Facebook and so on

# What is business analytics?

- **Business analytics** is the scientific process of learning from data, transforming data into insight for making better decisions

- *Broader* than **business intelligence** which focuses on describing and predicting performance.

- *Broader* than **econometrics/statistics** which typically starts from theory (hypotheses or models), and analysts assess if the data supports or refutes.

- *Narrower* than **data science** as we are primarily focusing on *business problems*

# Getting The Right Information

- Only 36% of CIO’s believe management is using the right Information to run the business (*Gartner Research 2020*)

- Less than one in **ten** corporate executives believe they have the **necessary** information when they need it to make **critical** business decisions. 

- More than **half** of these senior executives are concerned that as a result of *missing* information, they may be making poor decisions and a quarter believe that management frequently or always gets its decisions wrong. (*Economist Intelligence Unit 2020*)

# So what?

## The biggest question in business analytics is ‘Why?’ 

---
# So what?

- Why is this happening? If you notice that there’s a pattern, ask, **“Why?”** 

- Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? 

- Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.-- *Carla Gentry, Data Scientist at Talent Analytics*


- **[Business analysts** are] able to think of ways touse data to solve problems that otherwise would have been unsolved, or solved using only intuition.*-- Peter Skomoroch, Former Principal Data Scientist at Link*
